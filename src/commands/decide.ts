// ABOUTME: rivet decide <system> <statement> - add design decision to system
// ABOUTME: Decisions capture the WHY (vs requirements which capture the WHAT)

// Usage:
//   rivet decide Router "async-first for high-concurrency workloads"
//   rivet decide Config "YAML over JSON for human readability"

// Decisions are single statements. When supplanted, remove the old one.
