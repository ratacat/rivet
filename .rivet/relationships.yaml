# .rivet/relationships.yaml - System relationships
# Defines how systems interact with each other
#
# Format: [FromSystem, relationship-type, ToSystem]
#
# DISCOVERY: If TLDR is available, run `tldr calls .` to discover
# call relationships automatically, then translate them here.

# Predefined relationship types (add your own as needed)
types:
  calls: "Runtime invocation - A calls functions in B"
  delegates-to: "Passes responsibility - A hands off work to B"
  depends-on: "Compile-time dependency - A needs B to exist"
  uses: "General usage - A uses B's functionality"
  wraps: "Wrapper pattern - A wraps B's interface"
  validates-with: "Validation - A validates using B"
  extends: "Extension - A extends B's behavior"
  implements: "Implementation - A implements B's interface"

# System relationships
# Example:
#   - [CLI, delegates-to, Parser]
#   - [CLI, routes-to, SystemManager]
