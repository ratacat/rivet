      # These guide decisions when things are ambiguous
      - "Simplicity over flexibility"
      - "User's words preserved, not restructured"
      - "Explicit over implicit"

    conventions:
      # Optional - codebase organization rules
      # Could reference a named convention set or define inline
      # Needs a name for this concept - TBD
      organization: null  # or: "standard-ts" or custom definition

  systems:
    # References to individual system entries
    # Each system has: description, requirements, symbols, relationships

# The project section is new - gives AI context before diving into systems
# Design values help AI make judgment calls that match user's style
# Conventions (optional) provide structure rules
