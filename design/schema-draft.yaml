# ABOUTME: Draft schema for terminology entries
# ABOUTME: This is the structure, not actual data

# Example entry showing all fields:
example_entry:
  ExampleSystem:
    type: system                    # system | concept (keep it simple)
    description: |
      User's words describing what this is, lightly cleaned.
      Keep it short - one or two sentences max.
    status: active                  # active | deprecated | replacing:OtherThing
    replaces: null                  # what this replaced, if anything

    requirements:                   # atomic statements - the WHAT
      - "Must do X"
      - "Must handle Y"

    decisions:                      # design rationale - the WHY
      - statement: "Use Redis for session storage"
        rationale: "Need sub-ms latency, team has Redis experience"
        replaces: null              # what decision this supplanted, if any
      - statement: "Async-first API design"
        rationale: "Preparing for high-concurrency workloads"

    symbols:                        # locked code names
      - ExampleSystem
      - createExampleSystem

    depends_on:                     # what this needs
      - OtherSystem
      - Config

    used_by:                        # what needs this
      - App
      - Tests

    differs_from:                   # disambiguation - things this is NOT
      - SimilarThing                # prevents scope confusion
      - RelatedButDifferent

# Schema rules:
rules:
  - description is required, max ~100 words
  - requirements are atomic single sentences (the WHAT)
  - decisions capture design rationale (the WHY) - statement + reasoning
  - decisions can note what they replaced, enabling evolution tracking
  - when a decision is fully supplanted, remove it (stay true to "what IS")
  - symbols are locked once set, changes require explicit migration
  - status transitions: active -> deprecated -> (deleted from file)
  - replacing:X status means this is actively replacing X
  - differs_from is optional but high value for similar-sounding things
