# ABOUTME: Layout - codebase organization conventions
# ABOUTME: Optional structure rules for file and system organization

name: Layout

command: "rivet layout"

concept:
  description: |
    Optional feature: define or use a set of conventions for
    organizing files and systems in the codebase.

    Provides rules about:
    - Where different types of files go
    - How to name directories
    - What structure is expected
    - What's "cool" and what's not

    Keeps things organized and clean. Gives AI guardrails
    about where to put new code.

  why_optional: |
    Not everyone wants this. Some codebases are already organized.
    Some people prefer flexibility. This is for people who want
    explicit structure rules.

  flavors:
    description: |
      Default "flavors" - common organization patterns you can
      adopt wholesale or customize.

    examples:
      - "standard-ts" - typical TypeScript project layout
      - "monorepo" - workspace-based organization
      - "feature-folders" - organize by feature not type
      - "flat" - minimal nesting, everything accessible

cli:
  show: "rivet layout"              # Show current layout rules
  set: "rivet layout <flavor>"      # Adopt a preset layout
  check: "rivet layout check"       # Verify codebase matches layout
