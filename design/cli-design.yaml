# ABOUTME: CLI design principles and command structure
# ABOUTME: Simple, sexy, well-thought-out syntax

principles:
  - CLI native - command-line tool first
  - Simple and sexy syntax
  - Minimal typing for common operations
  - Auto-commit each change for granular undo
  - Single tool use, multiple commits when batching

auto_commit:
  description: |
    Every rivet command that modifies rivet.yaml automatically commits the change.
    Single tool use, atomic operation, git handles undo.

  behavior: |
    1. Read rivet.yaml
    2. Make change
    3. Write rivet.yaml
    4. git add rivet.yaml
    5. git commit -m "rivet: <operation description>"

  batch_behavior: |
    When using rivet sync with multiple operations, each operation gets its
    own commit in sequence. One tool use, multiple commits.

    Example: rivet sync --add Router "..." --deprecate OldRouter
    Creates two commits:
      1. "rivet: add Router"
      2. "rivet: deprecate OldRouter"

    Each can be reverted individually with git revert.

  flags:
    --no-commit: "Skip auto-commit for this operation"

commands:

      - "rivet layout check          # verify codebase matches layout"

# Workflow summary:
# 1. rivet context → AI gets context
# 2. Conversation about changes, naming negotiation
# 3. AI runs commands (direct or sync)
# 4. Each change auto-committed
# 5. Don't like something? git revert the specific commit
