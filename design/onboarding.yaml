# ABOUTME: How users get started with Rivet

install_is_onboarding: |
  Rivet is a Claude Code plugin. The onboarding experience IS the install.
  See design/plugin-install.yaml for the full install flow.

  When user installs the plugin:
    1. Scan runs automatically (no user action needed)
    2. If .rivet/systems.yaml exists, prompt for what to do
    3. If not, create .rivet/ folder and systems.yaml from scan results
    4. User is immediately set up

post_install_optional:
  harvest: |
    After install, user can optionally run "rivet harvest" to extract
    decisions/requirements from their AI transcript history.
    This is interactive - user reviews and selects items.

new_project_note: |
  For brand new projects with no code yet, scan will find nothing.
  That's fine - .rivet/systems.yaml gets created with just project name/purpose.
  Systems are added as they're built.
