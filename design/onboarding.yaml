# ABOUTME: First-run experience and project initialization
# ABOUTME: How users get started with Rivet

first_install_experience:
  goal: |
    Super easy, feels good. User walks away with a useful
    first Rivet file, not an empty template.

  approach: |
    Use Claude Code (or any AI) to walk through questions
    about the codebase. Interactive onboarding that builds
    the initial rivet.yaml.

  questions_to_ask:
    - What's this project called? What does it do? (project context)
    - What are the main systems/components? (initial system list)
    - Any naming conventions we should know about? (terminology seeds)
    - What are the core design values? (high-level feel)
    - How is the codebase organized? (optional structure conventions)

  output: |
    A populated rivet.yaml with:
    - Project-level context
    - 2-5 initial system entries
    - Basic terminology locks
    - Ready to use immediately

non_interactive_fallback:
  description: |
    If user wants to skip interactive setup, just create
    minimal rivet.yaml with project name and empty systems.
    Can populate later.

  command: "rivet init --minimal"
