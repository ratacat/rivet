# ABOUTME: Defines the goals and purpose of the terminology system
# ABOUTME: What we're trying to accomplish and why

primary_goal: |
  Give automated structure for AIs integrating with a codebase,
  specifically around linguistic noise and drift, reducing confusion
  and hallucinations.

secondary_goals:
  architecture_tracking: |
    Maintain living architecture definitions that stay current as code
    changes. While vibe coding, you should always be able to point to
    a well-defined architecture document. As scope changes, refactors
    happen, things get renamed - the architecture stays accurate.

  requirements_persistence: |
    Keep requirements married to the systems they describe, moving
    forward through a changing environment. When things get refactored
    or renamed, requirements don't get lost - they travel with the
    system or get explicitly handled.

    Requirements have similar value to tests - an LLM can look at
    requirements, look at the system, and verify they match. That's
    high-value stuff worth preserving.

constraints:
  - This is a disambiguation system, not a documentation system
  - Only things that cause confusion deserve entries
  - Smaller is better - excessive entries create more noise than signal
  - Systems only, not every method/interface

threshold_for_entry:
  - Multiple files with clear boundary (a "system")
  - Has been confused before (reactive, not proactive documentation)
  - Non-obvious name or overlaps with similar concepts
